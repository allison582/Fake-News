					<h2>Everything That Can Go Wrong Listed!</h2>
				</header>


				<p>
				FULLERTON, CA - A worldwide consortium of scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers is nearing the completion of the ambitious, decade-long project of cataloging everything that can go wrong, project leader Dr. Thomas R. Kress announced at a press conference Tuesday.
				</p>

				<p>
				<q>We are mere weeks from finishing one of the most thorough and provocative scientific surveys of our time,</q> Kress said. <q>The catalog of every possible unfortunate scenario will complete the work of the ancient Phoenicians and the early Christian theologians. Soon, every hazardous possibility will be known to man.</q>
				</p>

				<p>
				<q>And listed,</q> Kress added.
				</p>

				<p>
				A short excerpt from page 55,623 of Project Awry:

				<ol>
					<li> run in stocking</li>
					<li> nuclear annihilation of planet</li>
					<li> phone system down</li>
					<li> balloon floats away</li>
					<li> glass eye falls out during speech</li>
					<li> hairdresser quits</li>
					<li> wolverine attacks child</li>
					<li> don't notice nosebleed for the first 10 minutes of your wedding</li>

					<li> mother throws out beloved old stuffed hippo</li>
					<li> pants stay unzipped all day</li>
					<li> favorite song used in aerosol cheese ad</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				Kress, a professor emeritus of mathematics and statistics at California State University and the author of several works on probability, would not say how many scenarios of error, peril, and misfortune exist. However, the list is widely believed to include hundreds of trillions of potential scenarios, from <q>cement truck with soft brakes cutting swath of destruction across quiet suburban subdivision</q> to <q>snagging shirt cuff on door latch.</q>
				</p>

				<p>
				<q>You know that thing when you don't invite an annoying friend to your party, and then, on the night of the party, an acquaintance from work brings that friend as a date?</q> said Project Awry researcher Hideko Manabe of Kyoto University. <q>That's on the list.</q>
				</p>	

				<p>
				Manabe added: <q>I believe it's right after neglecting the maintenance of reactor cooling system, leading to core meltdown.</q>

					<h2>Minnesota <q>Lakes</q> a Fraud!</h2>
					<img class="rightpics" src="img/marsh.jpg" alt="marsh pic">

				<p>
				MINNEAPOLIS, MN - The National Wildlife Federation has declared Minnesota's claim of 10,000 lakes to be a fraud and is demanding an assessment from the governor.
				</p>

				<p>
				In a rare move, the President of the National Wildlife Federation, Ona Pond, has requested the State of Minnesota to demote many of its so-called lakes to ponds. An excerpt from the court document contends,  

				<blockquote>In the face of global climate change, we can no longer ignore the rapidly changing status of our nation's freshwater sources.  Minnesota boasts of <q>10,000 lakes</q> which is preposterous and must be rectified. Many such <q>lakes</q> are no more than a marsh full of cattails or a green swamp void of wildlife. Our country needs to face up to this crisis in freshwater management.
				</blockquote>

				<p>
				This aggressive posturing has been coldy received by Minnesota authorities. The Director of Lakes, Michael Splash, counters that the definition of a lake is not clearcut. <q>Lakes come in all shapes and sizes, and we in Minnesota love them all. Let's not jump to any conclusions.</q><p>

				<p>
				Minnesota residents, while proud of their traditions on the water all year-long, from ice-fishing to kayaking, acknowledge there is a problem. Nick Holmes, a resident of Minnetonka, no longer puts his canoe in to the 'Big Lake' for the summer. <q>I mean, it's depressing. I can't even paddle over to Joe's across the bay anymore- I get stuck on tree roots!</q>
				</p>

				<p>
				The declining status of Minnesota's waterways is revealed in the annual survey of ecological health, published by the Minnesota Nature Lover's Organization(<abbr title="Minnesota Nature Lover's Organization">MNLO</abbr>).  In addition to drastically reduced volumes of water held by the lakes, the observed wildlife has plummeted. 
				</p>
				<p>The governor declined to comment on this story.</p>

				<h2>Life Discovered on Comet 67P</h2>

				</header>

				<p>DARMSTADT, Germany. The European Space Agency annouced today that life has been detected on Comet 67P. If confirmed, this will be the most significant discovery in human history.</p>
				<p>Earlier in November, the space probe Rosetta landed gracefully on the soft surface of Comet 67P.  There were already indications that the mission would find something unusual- the comet was spewing smelly chemicals such as sulfur and ammonia.</p>
				<p>After several days of surface documentation, the probe inserted a long needle to sample the composition under the surface. The needle returned to the probe with the tip completely missing. Later tests showed that tip had been <em>eaten</em> by active microorganisms which inhabit the subterranean crust.</p>
				<p>Researchers are beside themselves with excitement as they plan further testing on these extraordinary creatures.</p>
